STAGE/COMMIT/PUSH/PULL

If jfm makes changes and commits and pushes the changes then you get them by:
git pull

If cle makes changes then....
git add -u #updates every that's being tracked
git commit -m "what I did"
git push

If cle adds a file:
vi file.txt...
git add file.txt
git commit -m "I added a file" 
git push

If there's a conflict (we both edited same file)
There are ways to deal with.
